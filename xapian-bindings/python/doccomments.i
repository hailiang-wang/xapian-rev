This class implements the BB2 weighting scheme.

BB2 is a representative scheme of the Divergence from Randomness
Framework by Gianni Amati.

It uses the Bose-Einstein probabilistic distribution (B) along with
Stirling's power approximation, the Bernoulli method to find the
aftereffect of sampling (B) and the second wdf normalization proposed
by Amati to normalize the wdf in the document to the length of the
document (H2).

For more information about the DFR Framework and the BB2 scheme,
please refer to : Gianni Amati and Cornelis Joost Van Rijsbergen

Parameters:
-----------

k1:  A non-negative parameter controlling how influential within-
document- frequency (wdf) is. k1=0 means that wdf doesn't affect the
weights. The larger k1 is, the more wdf influences the weights.
(default 1)

k2:  A non-negative parameter which controls the strength of a
correction factor which depends upon query length and normalised
document length. k2=0 disable this factor; larger k2 makes it
stronger. The paper which describes BM25+ ignores BM25's document-
independent component (so implicitly k2=0), but we support non-zero k2
too. (default 0)

k3:  A non-negative parameter controlling how influential within-
query- frequency (wqf) is. k3=0 means that wqf doesn't affect the
weights. The larger k3 is, the more wqf influences the weights.
(default 1)

b:  A parameter between 0 and 1, controlling how strong the document
length normalisation of wdf is. 0 means no normalisation; 1 means full
normalisation. (default 0.5)

min_normlen:  A parameter specifying a minimum value for normalised
document length. Normalised document length values less than this will
be clamped to this value, helping to prevent very short documents
getting large weights. (default 0.5)

delta:  A parameter for pseudo tf value to control the scale of the tf
lower bound. Delta(δ) can be tuned for example from 0.0 to 1.5 but
BM25+ can still work effectively across collections with a fixed δ =
1.0. (default 1.0) ";

appropriate way.

The default implementation just returns tags[0].

For multipass this will currently get called multiple times for the
same key if there are duplicates to resolve in each pass, but this may
change in the future.

Since 1.4.6, an implementation of this method can return an empty
string to indicate that the appropriate result is to not set a value

%feature("docstring") Xapian::Database "

This class is used to access a database, or a group of databases.

For searching, this class is used in conjunction with an Enquire
object.

Parameters:
-----------

InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if an invalid argument is
supplied, for example, an unknown database type.

DatabaseOpeningError:  may be thrown if the database cannot be opened
(for example, a required file cannot be found).

DatabaseVersionError:  may be thrown if the database is in an
unsupported format (for example, created by a newer version of Xapian
which uses an incompatible format). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::add_database "

Add an existing database (or group of databases) to those accessed by

Create a Database with no databases in.

Xapian::Database::Database() ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::Database "

Open a Database, automatically determining the database backend to
use.

Xapian::Database::Database(const std::string &path, int flags=0)

Parameters:
-----------

path:  directory that the database is stored in.

flags:  Bitwise-or of Xapian::DB_* constants. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::Database "

Open a single-file Database.

Xapian::Database::Database(int fd, int flags=0)

This method opens a single-file Database given a file descriptor open
on it. Xapian looks starting at the current file offset, allowing a
single file database to be easily embedded within another file.

Parameters:
-----------

fd:  file descriptor for the file. Xapian takes ownership of this and
will close it when the database is closed.

flags:  Bitwise-or of Xapian::DB_* constants. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::~Database "

Destroy this handle on the database.

virtual Xapian::Database::~Database()

be closed. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::Database "

Copying is allowed.

Xapian::Database::Database(const Database &other)

The internals are reference counted, so copying is cheap.

Parameters:
-----------

other:  The object to copy. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::reopen "

Re-open the database.

bool Xapian::Database::reopen()

This re-opens the database(s) to the latest available version(s). It
can be used either to make sure the latest results are returned, or to
recover from a Xapian::DatabaseModifiedError.

Calling reopen() on a database which has been closed (with  close())
will always raise a Xapian::DatabaseError.

true if the database might have been reopened (if false is returned,
the database definitely hasn't been reopened, which applications may
find useful when caching results, etc). In Xapian < 1.3.0, this method
did not return a value. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Database::close "

Close the database.

virtual void Xapian::Database::close()

This closes the database and closes all its file handles.

For a WritableDatabase, if a transaction is active it will be aborted,
while if no transaction is active commit() will be implicitly called.
Also the write lock is released.

Closing a database cannot be undone - in particular, calling reopen()
after close() will not reopen it, but will instead throw a
Xapian::DatabaseError exception.

Calling close() again on a database which has already been closed has
no effect (and doesn't raise an exception).

After close() has been called, calls to other methods of the database,
and to methods of other objects associated with the database, will
either:

behave exactly as they would have done if the database had not been
closed (this can only happen if all the required data is cached)

raise a Xapian::DatabaseError exception indicating that the database
is closed.

The reason for this behaviour is that otherwise we'd have to check
that the database is still open on every method call on every object
associated with a Database, when in many cases they are working on
data which has already been loaded and so they are able to just behave
correctly.

This method was added in Xapian 1.1.0. ";

User-specified metadata allows you to store arbitrary information in
the form of (key, value) pairs. See  WritableDatabase::set_metadata()
for more information.

When invoked on a Xapian::Database object representing multiple
databases, currently only the metadata for the first is considered but
this behaviour may change in the future.

If there is no piece of metadata associated with the specified key, an
empty string is returned (this applies even for backends which don't
support metadata).

Empty keys are not valid, and specifying one will cause an exception.

Parameters:
-----------

key:  The key of the metadata item to access.

The retrieved metadata item's value.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if the key supplied is
empty. ";

Parameters:
-----------

output:  Path to write the compact version to. This can be the same as
an input if that input is a stub database (in which case the
database(s) listed in the stub will be compacted to a new database and
then the stub will be atomically updated to point to this new

renumbered the output - currently by applying the same offset to all
the document ids in a particular source database. If this flag is
specified, then this renumbering doesn't happen, but all the document
ids must be unique over all source databases. Currently the ranges of
document ids in each source must not overlap either, though this
restriction may be removed in the future.

Xapian::DBCOMPACT_MULTIPASS If merging more than 3 databases, merge
the postlists in multiple passes, which is generally faster but

Constructor.

Xapian::DateRangeProcessor::DateRangeProcessor(Xapian::valueno slot_,
const std::string &str_, unsigned flags_=0, int epoch_year_=1970)

Parameters:
-----------

slot_:  The value slot number to query.

str_:  A string to look for to recognise values as belonging to this
date range.

flags_:  Zero or more of the following flags, combined with bitwise-
or: Xapian::RP_SUFFIX - require str_ as a suffix instead of a prefix.

Xapian::RP_REPEATED - optionally allow str_ on both ends of the range
- e.g. $1..$10 or 5m..50m. By default a prefix is only checked for on
the start (e.g. date:1/1/1980..31/12/1989), and a suffix only on the
end (e.g. 2..12kg).

Xapian::RP_DATE_PREFER_MDY - interpret ambiguous dates as
month/day/year rather than day/month/year.

epoch_year_:  Year to use as the epoch for dates with 2 digit years
(default: 1970, so 1/1/69 is 2069 while 1/1/70 is 1970).

The string supplied in str_ is used by operator() to decide whether
the pair of strings supplied to it constitute a valid range. If
prefix_ is true, the first value in a range must begin with str_ (and
the second value may optionally begin with str_); if prefix_ is false,
the second value in a range must end with str_ (and the first value
may optionally end with str_).

If str_ is empty, the Xapian::RP_SUFFIX and Xapian::RP_REPEATED are
irrelevant, and no special strings are required at the start or end of
the strings defining the range.

The remainder of both strings defining the endpoints must be valid
dates.

For example, if str_ is \"created:\", Xapian::RP_SUFFIX is not
specified, and the range processor has been added to the queryparser,
the queryparser will accept \"created:1/1/2000..31/12/2001\". ";

epoch_year_:  Year to use as the epoch for dates with 2 digit years

prefix_:  Whether to look for the string at the start or end of the
values. If true, the string is a prefix; if false, the string is a
suffix (default: true).

prefer_mdy_:  Should ambiguous dates be interpreted as month/day/year

%feature("docstring") Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource "

Read weights from a value which is known to decrease as docid
increases.

This posting source can be used, like ValueWeightPostingSource, to add
a weight contribution to a query based on the values stored in a slot.
The values in the slot must be serialised as by  sortable_serialise().

However, this posting source is additionally given a range of document
IDs, within which the weight is known to be decreasing. ie, for all
documents with ids A and B within this range (including the
endpoints), where A is less than B, the weight of A is less than or
equal to the weight of B. This can allow the posting source to skip to
the end of the range quickly if insufficient weight is left in the
posting source for a particular source.

By default, the range is assumed to cover all document IDs.

indexed database to produce a new, sorted, database. ";

Return the weight contribution for the current document.

double Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::get_weight() const

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource*
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::clone() const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way
(for example when wrapping the Xapian API for use from another
language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:https://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1 ";

%feature("docstring")

std::string Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::name() const

This is used when serialising and unserialising posting sources; for

If the subclass is in a C++ namespace, the namespace should be
included in the name, using \"::\" as a separator. For example, for a
PostingSource subclass called \"FooPostingSource\" in the \"Xapian\"
namespace the result of this call should be
\"Xapian::FooPostingSource\".

This should only be implemented if serialise() and unserialise() are

Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::init "

Set this PostingSource to the start of the list of postings.

void Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::init(const
Xapian::Database &db_)

This is called automatically by the matcher prior to each query being
processed.

If a PostingSource is used for multiple searches,  init() will
therefore be called multiple times, and must handle this by using the
database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or
returned from, the PostingSource refer to docids in that single
database, rather than in the multi- database. ";

Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

void Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::next(double min_wt)

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so
next(), skip_to() or check() must be called before any methods which
need the context of the current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid
min_docid, double min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::DecreasingValueWeightPostingSource::check(Xapian::docid
min_docid, double min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to check.

// File: classXapian_1_1Document.xml
%feature("docstring") Xapian::Document "

A handle representing a document in a Xapian database.

The Document class fetches information from the database lazily.
Usually this behaviour isn't visible to users (except for the speed
benefits), but if the document in the database is modified or deleted,
then preexisting Document objects may return the old or new versions
of data (or throw Xapian::DocNotFoundError in the case of deletion).

Since Database objects work on a snapshot of the database's state, the
situation above can only happen with a WritableDatabase object, or if
you call Database::reopen() on a Database object.

We recommend you avoid designs where this behaviour is an issue, but
if you need a way to make a non-lazy version of a Document object, you
can do this like so:doc =
Xapian::Document::unserialise(doc.serialise()); ";

Add an occurrence of a term at a particular position.

void Xapian::Document::add_posting(const std::string &tname,

Multiple occurrences of the term at the same position are represented
only once in the positional information, but do increase the wdf.

If the term is not already in the document, it will be added to it.

Parameters:

(default: 1). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Document::add_boolean_term "

Add a boolean filter term to the document.

void Xapian::Document::add_boolean_term(const std::string &term)

This method adds term to the document with wdf of 0 - this is
generally what you want for a term used for boolean filtering as the
wdf of such terms is ignored, and it doesn't make sense for them to
contribute to the document's length.

If the specified term already indexes this document, this method has
no effect.

It is exactly the same as add_term(term, 0).

This method was added in Xapian 1.0.18.

Parameters:
-----------

term:  The term to add. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Document::remove_posting "

Remove a posting of a term from the document.

void Xapian::Document::remove_posting(const std::string &tname,
Xapian::termpos tpos, Xapian::termcount wdfdec=1)

Note that the term will still index the document even if all
occurrences are removed. To remove a term from a document completely,
use remove_term().

Parameters:
-----------

tname:  The name of the term.

tpos:  The position of the term.

wdfdec:  The decrement that will be applied to the wdf when removing
this posting. The wdf will not go below the value of 0.

Parameters:
-----------

the position specified in the position list for this term in this
document.

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if the term is not in

&term, Xapian::termpos term_pos_first, Xapian::termpos term_pos_last,
Xapian::termcount wdf_dec=1)

Any instances of the term at positions >= term_pos_first and <=
term_pos_last will be removed, and the wdf reduced by wdf_dec for each
instance removed (the wdf will not ever go below zero though).

It's OK if the term doesn't occur in the range of positions specified
(unlike  remove_posting()). And if term_pos_first > term_pos_last,
this method does nothing.

The number of postings removed.

Parameters:
-----------

// File: classXapian_1_1Enquire.xml
%feature("docstring") Xapian::Enquire "

This class provides an interface to the information retrieval system
for the purpose of searching.

Databases are usually opened lazily, so exceptions may not be thrown
where you would expect them to be. You should catch Xapian::Error
exceptions when calling any method in Xapian::Enquire.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if an invalid argument
is supplied, for example, an unknown database type. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::Enquire "

Copying is allowed (and is cheap).

Xapian::Enquire::Enquire(const Enquire &other) ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::Enquire "

Create a Xapian::Enquire object.

Xapian::Enquire::Enquire(const Database &database)

This specification cannot be changed once the Xapian::Enquire is
opened: you must create a new Xapian::Enquire object to access a
different database, or set of databases.

The database supplied must have been initialised (ie, must not be the
result of calling the Database::Database() constructor). If you need
to handle a situation where you have no databases gracefully, a
database created with DB_BACKEND_INMEMORY can be passed here to
provide a completely empty database.

Parameters:
-----------

database:  Specification of the database or databases to use.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if an empty Database
object is supplied. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::Enquire "

Query object. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::add_matchspy "

Add a matchspy.

void Xapian::Enquire::add_matchspy(MatchSpy *spy)

This matchspy will be called with some of the documents which match
the query, during the match process. Exactly which of the matching
documents are passed to it depends on exactly when certain
optimisations occur during the match process, but it can be controlled
to some extent by setting the checkatleast parameter to  get_mset().

In particular, if there are enough matching documents, at least the
number specified by checkatleast will be passed to the matchspy. This
means that you can force the matchspy to be shown all matching
documents by setting checkatleast to the number of documents in the
database.

Parameters:
-----------

spy:  The MatchSpy subclass to add. The caller must ensure that this
remains valid while the Enquire object remains active, or until
clear_matchspies() is called. ";

If you don't call this method, the default is as if you'd used:

get_expansion_scheme(\"trad\");

Parameters:
-----------

eweightname_:  A string in lowercase specifying the name of the scheme
to be used. The following schemes are currently available: \"bo1\" :
The Bo1 scheme for query expansion. \"trad\" : The TradWeight scheme
for query expansion.

expand_k_:  The parameter required for TradWeight query expansion. A
default value of 1.0 is used if none is specified. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_collapse_key "

Set the collapse key to use for queries.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_collapse_key(Xapian::valueno collapse_key,
Xapian::doccount collapse_max=1)

Parameters:
-----------

collapse_key:  value number to collapse on - at most one MSet entry
with each particular value will be returned (default is
Xapian::BAD_VALUENO which means no collapsing).

collapse_max:  Max number of items with the same key to leave after
collapsing (default 1).

The MSet returned by get_mset() will have only the \"best\" (at most)
collapse_max entries with each particular value of collapse_key
(\"best\" being highest ranked - i.e. highest weight or highest
sorting key).

An example use might be to create a value for each document containing
an MD5 hash of the document contents. Then duplicate documents from
different sources can be eliminated at search time by collapsing with
collapse_max = 1 (it's better to eliminate duplicates at index time,
but this may not be always be possible - for example the search may be
over more than one Xapian database).

Another use is to group matches in a particular category (e.g. you
might collapse a mailing list search on the Subject: so that there's
only one result per discussion thread). In this case you can use
get_collapse_count() to give the user some idea how many other results
there are. And if you index the Subject: as a boolean term as well as
putting it in a value, you can offer a link to a non-collapsed search
restricted to that thread using a boolean filter. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_docid_order "

Set sort order for document IDs.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_docid_order(docid_order order)

This order only has an effect on documents which would otherwise have
equal rank. When ordering by relevance without a sort key, this means
documents with equal weight. For a boolean match with no sort key,
this means all documents. And if a sort key is used, this means
documents with the same sort key (and also equal weight if ordering on
relevance before or after the sort key).

Parameters:
-----------

order:  This can be:  Xapian::Enquire::ASCENDING docids sort in
ascending order (default)

Xapian::Enquire::DESCENDING docids sort in descending order

Xapian::Enquire::DONT_CARE docids sort in whatever order is most
efficient for the backend

Note: If you add documents in strict date order, then a boolean search
- i.e. set_weighting_scheme(Xapian::BoolWeight()) - with
set_docid_order(Xapian::Enquire::DESCENDING) is an efficient way to
perform \"sort by date, newest first\", and with
set_docid_order(Xapian::Enquire::ASCENDING) a very efficient way to
perform \"sort by date, oldest first\". ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::set_cutoff "

Set the percentage and/or weight cutoffs.

void Xapian::Enquire::set_cutoff(int percent_cutoff, double
weight_cutoff=0)

Parameters:
-----------

percent_cutoff:  Minimum percentage score for returned documents. If a
document has a lower percentage score than this, it will not appear in
the MSet. If your intention is to return only matches which contain
all the terms in the query, then it's more efficient to use
Xapian::Query::OP_AND instead of Xapian::Query::OP_OR in the query
than to use set_cutoff(100). (default 0 => no percentage cut-off).

weight_cutoff:  Minimum weight for a document to be returned. If a
document has a lower score that this, it will not appear in the MSet.
It is usually only possible to choose an appropriate weight for cutoff
based on the results of a previous run of the same query; this is thus
mainly useful for alerting operations. The other potential use is with
a user specified weighting scheme. (default 0 => no weight cut-off).

reverse:  If true, reverses the sort order of sort_key. Beware that in
1.2.16 and earlier, the sense of this parameter was incorrectly

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::get_mset "

Get (a portion of) the match set for the current query.

MSet Xapian::Enquire::get_mset(Xapian::doccount first,
Xapian::doccount maxitems, Xapian::doccount checkatleast=0, const RSet
*omrset=0, const MatchDecider *mdecider=0) const

Parameters:
-----------

first:  the first item in the result set to return. A value of zero
corresponds to the first item returned being that with the highest
score. A value of 10 corresponds to the first 10 items being ignored,
and the returned items starting at the eleventh.

maxitems:  the maximum number of items to return. If you want all
matches, then you can pass the result of calling get_doccount() on the
Database object (though if you are doing this so you can filter
results, you are likely to get much better performance by using
Xapian's match-time filtering features instead). You can pass 0 for
maxitems which will give you an empty MSet with valid statistics (such
as get_matches_estimated()) calculated without looking at any
postings, which is very quick, but means the estimates may be more
approximate and the bounds may be much looser.

checkatleast:  the minimum number of items to check. Because the
matcher optimises, it won't consider every document which might match,
so the total number of matches is estimated. Setting checkatleast
forces it to consider at least this many matches and so allows for
reliable paging links.

omrset:  the relevance set to use when performing the query.

mdecider:  a decision functor to use to decide whether a given
document should be put in the MSet.

A Xapian::MSet object containing the results of the query.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  See class documentation. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin "

Get terms which match a given document, by document id.

TermIterator Xapian::Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin(Xapian::docid
did) const

This method returns the terms in the current query which match the
given document.

It is possible for the document to have been removed from the database
between the time it is returned in an MSet, and the time that this
call is made. If possible, you should specify an MSetIterator instead
of a Xapian::docid, since this will enable database backends with
suitable support to prevent this occurring.

Note that a query does not need to have been run in order to make this
call.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id for which to retrieve the matching terms.

An iterator returning the terms which match the document. The terms
will be returned (as far as this makes any sense) in the same order as
the terms in the query. Terms will not occur more than once, even if
they do in the query.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  See class documentation.

Xapian::DocNotFoundError:  The document specified could not be found
in the database. ";

Get terms which match a given document, by match set item.

TermIterator Xapian::Enquire::get_matching_terms_begin(const
MSetIterator &it) const

This method returns the terms in the current query which match the
given document.

If the underlying database has suitable support, using this call
(rather than passing a Xapian::docid) will enable the system to ensure
that the correct data is returned, and that the document has not been
deleted or changed since the query was performed.

Parameters:
-----------

it:  The iterator for which to retrieve the matching terms.

An iterator returning the terms which match the document. The terms
will be returned (as far as this makes any sense) in the same order as
the terms in the query. Terms will not occur more than once, even if
they do in the query.

Return the weight contribution for the current document.

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

void Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::next(double min_wt)

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so
next(), skip_to() or check() must be called before any methods which
need the context of the current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid
min_docid, double min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::check(Xapian::docid min_docid,
double min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.

did:  The document id to check.

Return the current docid.

Xapian::docid Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_docid() const

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". See  get_weight() for details.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the returned docid
should be in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

FixedWeightPostingSource* Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::clone()
const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way
(for example when wrapping the Xapian API for use from another
language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:https://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1 ";

Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::unserialise(const std::string
&serialised) const

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way
(for example when wrapping the Xapian API for use from another
language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:https://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1

If you don't want to support the remote backend, you can use the
default implementation which simply throws Xapian::UnimplementedError.

Parameters:
-----------

serialised:  A serialised instance of this PostingSource subclass. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::init "

Set this PostingSource to the start of the list of postings.

void Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::init(const Database &db_)

This is called automatically by the matcher prior to each query being
processed.

If a PostingSource is used for multiple searches,  init() will
therefore be called multiple times, and must handle this by using the
database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or
returned from, the PostingSource refer to docids in that single
database, rather than in the multi- database. ";

%feature("docstring")
Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_description "

std::string Xapian::FixedWeightPostingSource::get_description() const

This default implementation returns a generic answer. This default it
provided to avoid forcing those deriving their own PostingSource
subclass from having to implement this (they may not care what
get_description() gives for their subclass). ";

%feature("docstring") Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource "

Posting source which returns a weight based on geospatial distance.

Experimental - seehttps://xapian.org/docs/deprecation#experimental-
features

Results are weighted by the distance from a fixed point, or list of
points, calculated according to the metric supplied. If multiple
points are supplied (either in the constructor, or in the coordinates
stored in a document), the closest pointwise distance is used.

Documents further away than a specified maximum range (or with no
location stored in the specified slot) will not be returned.

The weight returned is computed from the distance using the formula:

k1 * pow(distance + k1, -k2)

(Where k1 and k2 are (strictly) positive, floating point constants,
which default to 1000 and 1, respectively. Distance is measured in
metres, so this means that something at the centre gets a weight of
1.0, something 1km away gets a weight of 0.5, and something 3km away
gets a weight of 0.25, etc) ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

void Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::next(double min_wt)

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so
next(), skip_to() or check() must be called before any methods which
need the context of the current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

void Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid
min_docid, double min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::check(Xapian::docid
min_docid, double min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.

did:  The document id to check.

Return the weight contribution for the current document.

double Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::get_weight() const

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

LatLongDistancePostingSource*
Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::clone() const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way

language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your

This method is supplied with a Registry object, which can be used when
unserialising objects contained within the posting source. The default
implementation simply calls unserialise() which doesn't take the
Registry object, so you do not need to implement this method unless
you want to take advantage of the Registry object when unserialising.

Parameters:
-----------

serialised:  A serialised instance of this PostingSource subclass.

registry:  The Xapian::Registry object to use. ";

Set this PostingSource to the start of the list of postings.

void Xapian::LatLongDistancePostingSource::init(const Database &db_)

This is called automatically by the matcher prior to each query being
processed.

If a PostingSource is used for multiple searches,  init() will
therefore be called multiple times, and must handle this by using the
database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or
returned from, the PostingSource refer to docids in that single

This method selects a continuous run of words from text, based mainly
on where the query matches (currently terms, exact phrases and
wildcards are taken into account). If flag SNIPPET_BACKGROUND_MODEL is
used (which it is by default) then the selection algorithm also
considers the non-query terms in the text with the aim of showing a
context which provides more useful information.

The size of the text selected can be controlled by the length
parameter, which specifies a number of bytes of text to aim to select.
However slightly more text may be selected. Also the size of any
escaping, highlighting or omission markers is not considered.

The returned text is escaped to make it suitable for use in HTML
(though beware that in upstream releases 1.4.5 and earlier this
escaping was sometimes incomplete), and matches with the query will be
highlighted using hi_start and hi_end.

If the snippet seems to start or end mid-sentence, then omit is
prepended or append (respectively) to indicate this.

The same stemming algorithm which was used to build the query should
be specified in stemmer.

KeyMaker subclass which combines several values.

When the result is used for sorting, results are ordered by the first
value. In the event of a tie, the second is used. If this is the same
for both, the third is used, and so on. If reverse is true for a
value, then the sort order for that value is reversed.

When used for collapsing, the documents will only be considered equal
if all the values specified match. If none of the specified values are
set then the generated key will be empty, so such documents won't be
collapsed (which is consistent with the behaviour in the \"collapse on
a value\" case). If you'd prefer that documents with none of the keys
set are collapsed together, then you can set reverse for at least one

Constructor.

Xapian::NumberRangeProcessor::NumberRangeProcessor(Xapian::valueno
slot_, const std::string &str_=std::string(), unsigned flags_=0)

Parameters:
-----------

slot_:  The value slot number to query.

str_:  A string to look for to recognise values as belonging to this
numeric range.

flags_:  Zero or more of the following flags, combined with bitwise-
or: Xapian::RP_SUFFIX - require str_ as a suffix instead of a prefix.

Xapian::RP_REPEATED - optionally allow str_ on both ends of the range
- e.g. $1..$10 or 5m..50m. By default a prefix is only checked for on
the start (e.g. date:1/1/1980..31/12/1989), and a suffix only on the
end (e.g. 2..12kg).

The string supplied in str_ is used by operator() to decide whether
the pair of strings supplied to it constitute a valid range. If
prefix_ is true, the first value in a range must begin with str_ (and
the second value may optionally begin with str_); if prefix_ is false,
the second value in a range must end with str_ (and the first value
may optionally end with str_).

If str_ is empty, the setting of prefix_ is irrelevant, and no special
strings are required at the start or end of the strings defining the
range.

The remainder of both strings defining the endpoints must be valid
floating point numbers. (FIXME: define format recognised).

For example, if str_ is \"$\" and prefix_ is true, and the range
processor has been added to the queryparser, the queryparser will
accept \"$10..50\" or \"$10..$50\", but not \"10..50\" or \"10..$50\"

An estimate of the number of documents this object can return.

An upper bound on the number of documents this object can return.

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::set_maxweight "

Specify an upper bound on what get_weight() will return from now on.

void Xapian::PostingSource::set_maxweight(double max_weight)

This upper bound is used by the matcher to perform various
optimisations, so if you can return a good bound, then matches will
generally run faster.

This method should be called after calling init(), and may be called
during iteration if the upper bound drops. It is probably only useful
to call from subclasses (it was actually a \"protected\" method prior
to Xapian 1.3.4, but that makes it tricky to wrap for other
languages).

It is valid for the posting source to have returned a higher value
from get_weight() earlier in the iteration, but the posting source
must not return a higher value from get_weight() than the currently
set upper bound, and the upper bound must not be increased (until
init() has been called).

If you don't call this method, the upper bound will default to 0, for
convenience when implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource
subclasses.

Parameters:
-----------

max_weight:  The upper bound to set. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::get_maxweight "

Return the currently set upper bound on what get_weight() can return.

double Xapian::PostingSource::get_maxweight() const ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::get_weight "

Return the weight contribution for the current document.

virtual double Xapian::PostingSource::get_weight() const

This default implementation always returns 0, for convenience when
implementing \"weight-less\" PostingSource subclasses.

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". In detail: Xapian will always call init() on a
PostingSource before calling this for the first time. It will also
only call this if the PostingSource reports that it is pointing to a
valid document (ie, it will not call it before calling at least one of
next(), skip_to() or check(), and will ensure that the PostingSource
is not at the end by calling at_end()). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::get_docid "

Return the current docid.

virtual Xapian::docid Xapian::PostingSource::get_docid() const =0

This method may assume that it will only be called when there is a
\"current document\". See  get_weight() for details.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the returned docid
should be in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::next "

Advance the current position to the next matching document.

virtual void Xapian::PostingSource::next(double min_wt)=0

The PostingSource starts before the first entry in the list, so
next(), skip_to() or check() must be called before any methods which
need the context of the current position.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Parameters:
-----------

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::skip_to "

Advance to the specified docid.

virtual void Xapian::PostingSource::skip_to(Xapian::docid did, double
min_wt)

If the specified docid isn't in the list, position ourselves on the
first document after it (or at_end() if no greater docids are
present).

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method
will leave the position unmodified.

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the
behaviour is unspecified. A sensible behaviour would be to leave the
current position unmodified, but it is also reasonable to move to the
specified docid.

The default implementation calls next() repeatedly, which works but
skip_to() can often be implemented much more efficiently.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to advance to.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

virtual bool Xapian::PostingSource::check(Xapian::docid did, double
min_wt)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database. If it does, it must move to that
document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian will always call init() on a PostingSource before calling this
for the first time.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, the docid specified is
the docid in the single subdatabase relevant to this posting source.
See the  init() method for details.

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document id to check.

min_wt:  The minimum weight contribution that is needed (this is just
a hint which subclasses may ignore). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::at_end "

Return true if the current position is past the last entry in this
list.

virtual bool Xapian::PostingSource::at_end() const =0

At least one of  next(),  skip_to() or  check() will be called before
this method is first called. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::clone "

Clone the posting source.

virtual PostingSource* Xapian::PostingSource::clone() const

The clone should inherit the configuration of the parent, but need not
inherit the state. ie, the clone does not need to be in the same
iteration position as the original: the matcher will always call
init() on the clone before attempting to move the iterator, or read
the information about the current position of the iterator.

This may return NULL to indicate that cloning is not supported. In
this case, the PostingSource may only be used with a single-database
search.

The default implementation returns NULL.

Note that the returned object will be deallocated by Xapian after use
with \"delete\". If you want to handle the deletion in a special way
(for example when wrapping the Xapian API for use from another
language) then you can define a static operator delete method in your
subclass as shown here:https://trac.xapian.org/ticket/554#comment:1 ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::name "

Name of the posting source class.

virtual std::string Xapian::PostingSource::name() const

This is used when serialising and unserialising posting sources; for
example, for performing remote searches.

If the subclass is in a C++ namespace, the namespace should be
included in the name, using \"::\" as a separator. For example, for a
PostingSource subclass called \"FooPostingSource\" in the \"Xapian\"
namespace the result of this call should be
\"Xapian::FooPostingSource\".

This should only be implemented if serialise() and unserialise() are
also implemented. The default implementation returns an empty string.

If this returns an empty string, Xapian will assume that serialise()
and unserialise() are not implemented. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::serialise "

Serialise object parameters into a string.

virtual std::string Xapian::PostingSource::serialise() const

The serialised parameters should represent the configuration of the
posting source, but need not (indeed, should not) represent the
current iteration state.

default implementation which simply throws Xapian::UnimplementedError.

This method is supplied with a Registry object, which can be used when
unserialising objects contained within the posting source. The default
implementation simply calls unserialise() which doesn't take the
Registry object, so you do not need to implement this method unless
you want to take advantage of the Registry object when unserialising.

Parameters:
-----------

serialised:  A serialised instance of this PostingSource subclass.

registry:  The Xapian::Registry object to use. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::PostingSource::init "

Set this PostingSource to the start of the list of postings.

virtual void Xapian::PostingSource::init(const Database &db)=0

This is called automatically by the matcher prior to each query being
processed.

If a PostingSource is used for multiple searches,  init() will
therefore be called multiple times, and must handle this by using the
database passed in the most recent call.

Parameters:
-----------

db:  The database which the PostingSource should iterate through.

Note: in the case of a multi-database search, a separate PostingSource
will be used for each database (the separate PostingSources will be
obtained using  clone()), and each PostingSource will be passed one of
the sub-databases as the db parameter here. The db parameter will
therefore always refer to a single database. All docids passed to, or
returned from, the PostingSource refer to docids in that single
database, rather than in the multi- database. ";

strategy set by set_stemming_strategy(). As of 1.3.1, this defaults to
STEM_SOME, but in earlier versions the default was STEM_NONE. If you
want to work with older versions, you should explicitly set a stemming
strategy as well as setting a stemmer, otherwise your stemmer won't
actually be used.

Parameters:

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemming_strategy "

Set the stemming strategy.

void Xapian::QueryParser::set_stemming_strategy(stem_strategy
strategy)

This controls how the query parser will apply the stemming algorithm.
Note that the stemming algorithm is only applied to words in free-text
fields - boolean filter terms are never stemmed.

Parameters:
-----------

strategy:  The strategy to use - possible values are: STEM_NONE: Don't
perform any stemming. (default in Xapian <= 1.3.0)

STEM_SOME: Stem all terms except for those which start with a capital
letter, or are followed by certain characters (currently: (/@<>=*[{\"

Stemmed terms are prefixed with 'Z'. (default in Xapian >= 1.3.1)

STEM_SOME_FULL_POS: Like STEM_SOME but also stems terms used with
operators which need positional information. Added in Xapian 1.4.8.

STEM_ALL: Stem all terms (note: no 'Z' prefix is added).

STEM_ALL_Z: Stem all terms (note: 'Z' prefix is added). (new in Xapian
1.2.11 and 1.3.1) ";

So for example, 'weather forecast' is parsed as if it were 'weather OR
forecast' by default.

The most useful values for this are OP_OR (the default) and OP_AND.

Query Xapian::QueryParser::parse_query(const std::string
&query_string, unsigned flags=FLAG_DEFAULT, const std::string
&default_prefix=std::string())

Parameters:
-----------

query_string:  A free-text query as entered by a user

flags:  Zero or more QueryParser::feature_flag specifying what
features the QueryParser should support. Combine multiple values with
bitwise-or (|) (default FLAG_DEFAULT).

default_prefix:  The default term prefix to use (default none). For
example, you can pass \"A\" when parsing an \"Author\" field.

Parameters:
-----------

If:  the query string can't be parsed, then Xapian::QueryParserError
is thrown. You can get an English error message to report to the user
by catching it and calling get_msg() on the caught exception. The
current possible values (in case you want to translate them) are:

Unknown range operation

parse error

Syntax: <expression> AND <expression>

Syntax: <expression> AND NOT <expression>

Syntax: <expression> NOT <expression>

Syntax: <expression> OR <expression>

Syntax: <expression> XOR <expression> ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix "

Add a free-text field term prefix.

void Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix(const std::string &field, const
std::string &prefix)

For example:

This allows the user to search for author:Orwell which will be
converted to a search for the term \"Aorwell\".

Multiple fields can be mapped to the same prefix. For example, you can
make title: and subject: aliases for each other.

As of 1.0.4, you can call this method multiple times with the same
value of field to allow a single field to be mapped to multiple
prefixes. Multiple terms being generated for such a field, and
combined with Xapian::Query::OP_OR.

If any prefixes are specified for the empty field name (i.e. you call
this method with an empty string as the first parameter) these
prefixes will be used for terms without a field specifier. If you do
this and also specify the default_prefix parameter to  parse_query(),
then the default_prefix parameter will override.

If the prefix parameter is empty, then \"field:word\" will produce the
term \"word\" (and this can be one of several prefixes for a
particular field, or for terms without a field specifier).

If you call  add_prefix() and  add_boolean_prefix() for the same value
of field, a  Xapian::InvalidOperationError exception will be thrown.

In 1.0.3 and earlier, subsequent calls to this method with the same
value of field had no effect.

Parameters:
-----------

field:  The user visible field name

prefix:  The term prefix to map this to ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix "

Register a FieldProcessor.

void Xapian::QueryParser::add_prefix(const std::string &field,
Xapian::FieldProcessor *proc) ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_boolean_prefix "

Add a boolean term prefix allowing the user to restrict a search with
a boolean filter specified in the free text query.

void Xapian::QueryParser::add_boolean_prefix(const std::string &field,
const std::string &prefix, const std::string *grouping=NULL)

For example:

This allows the user to restrict a search with site:xapian.org which
will be converted to Hxapian.org combined with any weighted query with
Xapian::Query::OP_FILTER.

If multiple boolean filters are specified in a query for the same
prefix, they will be combined with the Xapian::Query::OP_OR operator.
Then, if there are boolean filters for different prefixes, they will
be combined with the Xapian::Query::OP_AND operator.

Multiple fields can be mapped to the same prefix (so for example you
can make site: and domain: aliases for each other). Instances of
fields with different aliases but the same prefix will still be
combined with the OR operator.

For example, if \"site\" and \"domain\" map to \"H\", but author maps
to \"A\", a search for \"site:foo domain:bar author:Fred\" will map to
\"(Hfoo OR Hbar) AND Afred\".

As of 1.0.4, you can call this method multiple times with the same
value of field to allow a single field to be mapped to multiple
prefixes. Multiple terms being generated for such a field, and
combined with Xapian::Query::OP_OR.

Calling this method with an empty string for field will cause a
Xapian::InvalidArgumentError.

If you call  add_prefix() and  add_boolean_prefix() for the same value
of field, a  Xapian::InvalidOperationError exception will be thrown.

In 1.0.3 and earlier, subsequent calls to this method with the same
value of field had no effect.

Parameters:
-----------

field:  The user visible field name

prefix:  The term prefix to map this to

grouping:  Controls how multiple filters are combined - filters with
the same grouping value are combined with OP_OR, then the resulting
queries are combined with OP_AND. If NULL, then field is used for
grouping. If an empty string, then a unique grouping is created for
each filter (this is sometimes useful when each document can have
multiple terms with this prefix). [default: NULL] ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::QueryParser::add_boolean_prefix "

grouping parameter in preference to this one.

Parameters:
-----------

field:  The user visible field name

prefix:  The term prefix to map this to

exclusive:  Controls how multiple filters are combined. If true then
prefix is used as the grouping value, so terms with the same prefix
are combined with OP_OR, then the resulting queries are combined with
OP_AND. If false, then a unique grouping is created for each filter

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::TermGenerator::set_stemming_strategy "

Set the stemming strategy.

void Xapian::TermGenerator::set_stemming_strategy(stem_strategy
strategy)

This method controls how the stemming algorithm is applied. It was new
in Xapian 1.3.1.

Parameters:
-----------

strategy:  The strategy to use - possible values are: STEM_NONE: Don't
perform any stemming - only unstemmed terms are generated.

STEM_SOME: Generate both stemmed (with a \"Z\" prefix) and unstemmed
terms. No positional information is stored for unstemmed terms. This
is the default strategy.

STEM_SOME_FULL_POS: Like STEM_SOME but positional information is
stored for both stemmed and unstemmed terms. Added in Xapian 1.4.8.

STEM_ALL: Generate only stemmed terms (but without a \"Z\" prefix).

STEM_ALL_Z: Generate only stemmed terms (with a \"Z\" prefix). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::TermGenerator::set_stopper_strategy "

Set the stopper strategy.

void Xapian::TermGenerator::set_stopper_strategy(stop_strategy
strategy)

The method controls how the stopper is used. It was added in Xapian
1.4.1.

You need to also call  set_stopper() for this to have any effect.

Parameters:
-----------

strategy:  The strategy to use - possible values are: STOP_NONE: Don't
use the stopper.

STOP_ALL: If a word is identified as a stop word, skip it completely.

STOP_STEMMED: If a word is identified as a stop word, index its
unstemmed form but skip the stem. Unstemmed forms are indexed with
positional information by default, so this allows searches for phrases
containing stopwords to be supported. (This is the default mode). ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::TermGenerator::set_max_word_length "

Set the maximum length word to index.

void Xapian::TermGenerator::set_max_word_length(unsigned
max_word_length)

The limit is on the length of a word prior to stemming and prior to
adding any term prefix.

The backends mostly impose a limit on the length of terms (often of
about 240 bytes), but it's generally useful to have a lower limit to
help prevent the index being bloated by useless junk terms from trying
to indexing things like binary data, uuencoded data, ASCII art, etc.

This method was new in Xapian 1.3.1.

Parameters:
-----------

max_word_length:  The maximum length word to index, in bytes in UTF-8
representation. Default is 64. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::TermGenerator::index_text "

void Xapian::TermGenerator::index_text_without_positions(const
Xapian::Utf8Iterator &itor, Xapian::termcount wdf_inc=1, const
std::string &prefix=std::string())

Just like index_text, but no positional information is generated. This
means that the database will be significantly smaller, but that phrase
searching and NEAR won't be supported.

Parameters:
-----------

itor:   Utf8Iterator pointing to the text to index.

wdf_inc:  The wdf increment (default 1).

prefix:  The term prefix to use (default is no prefix). ";

places to prevent phrase searches from spanning between them (e.g.
between the title and body text, or between two chapters in a book).

Parameters:
-----------

delta:  Amount to increase the term position by (default: 100). ";

Construct a TfIdfWeight.

Xapian::TfIdfWeight::TfIdfWeight(const std::string &normalizations)

Parameters:
-----------

normalizations:  A three character string indicating the
normalizations to be used for the tf(wdf), idf and document weight.
(default: \"ntn\")

The normalizations string works like so:

The first character specifies the normalization for the wdf. The
following normalizations are currently supported:

'n': None. wdfn=wdf

'b': Boolean wdfn=1 if term in document else wdfn=0

's': Square wdfn=wdf*wdf

'l': Logarithmic wdfn=1+loge(wdf)

'L': Log average wdfn=(1+log(wdf))/(1+log(doclen/unique_terms))  The
Max-wdf and Augmented Max wdf normalizations haven't yet been
implemented.

The second character indicates the normalization for the idf. The
following normalizations are currently supported:

'n': None idfn=1

't': TfIdf idfn=log(N/Termfreq) where N is the number of documents in
collection and Termfreq is the number of documents which are indexed
by the term t.

'p': Prob idfn=log((N-Termfreq)/Termfreq)

'f': Freq idfn=1/Termfreq

's': Squared idfn=log(N/Termfreq)^2

The third and the final character indicates the normalization for the
document weight. The following normalizations are currently supported:

'n': None wtn=tfn*idfn  Implementing support for more normalizations
of each type would require extending the backend to track more
statistics. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValueIterator::skip_to "

Advance the iterator to document id or value slot docid_or_slot.

void Xapian::ValueIterator::skip_to(Xapian::docid docid_or_slot)

If this iterator is over values in a document, then this method
advances the iterator to value slot docid_or_slot, or the first slot
after it if there is no value in slot slot.

If this iterator is over values in a particular slot, then this method
advances the iterator to document id docid_or_slot, or the first
document id after it if there is no value in the slot we're iterating
over for document docid_or_slot.

Note: The \"two-faced\" nature of this method is due to how C++
overloading works. Xapian::docid and Xapian::valueno are both typedefs
for the same unsigned integer type, so overloading can't distinguish
them.

Parameters:
-----------

docid_or_slot:  The docid/slot to advance to. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::ValueIterator::check "

Check if the specified docid occurs.

bool Xapian::ValueIterator::check(Xapian::docid docid)

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did
actually exists in the database.

This method acts like skip_to() if that can be done at little extra
cost, in which case it then returns true. This is how chert and glass
databases behave because they store values in streams which allow for
an efficient implementation of skip_to().

Otherwise it simply checks if a particular docid is present. If it is,
it returns true. If it isn't, it returns false, and leaves the
position unspecified (and hence the result of calling methods which
depend on the current position, such as get_docid(), are also
unspecified). In this state, next() will advance to the first matching
position after document did, and skip_to() will act as it would if the
position was the first matching position after document did.

Currently the inmemory and remote backends behave in the latter way
because they don't support streamed values and so skip_to() must check
each document it skips over which is significantly slower.

Parameters:
-----------

docid:  The document id to check. ";

If the current position is already the specified docid, this method

If the specified docid is earlier than the current position, the

bool Xapian::ValuePostingSource::check(Xapian::docid min_docid, double

The caller is required to ensure that the specified document id did

document id, and return true. If it does not, it may either:

return true, having moved to a definite position (including
\"at_end\"), which must be the same position as skip_to() would have
moved to.

or

return false, having moved to an \"indeterminate\" position, such that
a subsequent call to next() or skip_to() will move to the next
matching position after did.

Generally, this method should act like skip_to() and return true if
that can be done at little extra cost.

Otherwise it should simply check if a particular docid is present,
returning true if it is, and false if it isn't.

The default implementation calls skip_to() and always returns true.

Xapian::WritableDatabase::WritableDatabase(const std::string &path,
int flags=0, int block_size=0)

If the database is to be created, Xapian will try to create the

leaf directory, not recursively).

Parameters:
-----------

path:  directory that the database is stored in.

flags:  one of:  Xapian::DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN open for read/write; create

Parameters:

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit "

Commit any pending modifications made to the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit()

For efficiency reasons, when performing multiple updates to a database
it is best (indeed, almost essential) to make as many modifications as
memory will permit in a single pass through the database. To ensure
this, Xapian batches up modifications.

This method may be called at any time to commit any pending
modifications to the database.

If any of the modifications fail, an exception will be thrown and the
database will be left in a state in which each separate addition,
replacement or deletion operation has either been fully performed or
not performed at all: it is then up to the application to work out
which operations need to be repeated.

It's not valid to call commit() within a transaction.

Beware of calling commit() too frequently: this will make indexing
take much longer.

Note that commit() need not be called explicitly: it will be called
automatically when the database is closed, or when a sufficient number
of modifications have been made. By default, this is every 10000
documents added, deleted, or modified. This value is rather
conservative, and if you have a machine with plenty of memory, you can
improve indexing throughput dramatically by setting
XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD in the environment to a larger value.

This method was new in Xapian 1.1.0 - in earlier versions it was
called flush().

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
modifying the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::flush "

Pre-1.1.0 name for commit().

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::flush()

Use commit() instead. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::begin_transaction "

Begin a transaction.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::begin_transaction(bool flushed=true)

In Xapian a transaction is a group of modifications to the database
which are linked such that either all will be applied simultaneously
or none will be applied at all. Even in the case of a power failure,
this characteristic should be preserved (as long as the filesystem
isn't corrupted, etc).

A transaction is started with begin_transaction() and can either be
committed by calling commit_transaction() or aborted by calling
cancel_transaction().

By default, a transaction implicitly calls commit() before and after
so that the modifications stand and fall without affecting
modifications before or after.

The downside of these implicit calls to commit() is that small
transactions can harm indexing performance in the same way that
explicitly calling commit() frequently can.

If you're applying atomic groups of changes and only wish to ensure
that each group is either applied or not applied, then you can prevent
the automatic commit() before and after the transaction by starting
the transaction with begin_transaction(false). However, if
cancel_transaction is called (or if commit_transaction isn't called
before the WritableDatabase object is destroyed) then any changes
which were pending before the transaction began will also be
discarded.

Transactions aren't currently supported by the InMemory backend.

Parameters:
-----------

flushed:  Is this a flushed transaction? By default transactions are
\"flushed\", which means that committing a transaction will ensure
those changes are permanently written to the database. By contrast,
unflushed transactions only ensure that changes within the transaction
are either all applied or all aren't.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if transactions are not
available for this database type.

Xapian::InvalidOperationError:  will be thrown if this is called at an
invalid time, such as when a transaction is already in progress. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit_transaction "

Complete the transaction currently in progress.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::commit_transaction()

If this method completes successfully and this is a flushed
transaction, all the database modifications made during the
transaction will have been committed to the database.

If an error occurs, an exception will be thrown, and none of the
modifications made to the database during the transaction will have
been applied to the database.

In all cases the transaction will no longer be in progress.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
modifying the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state.

Xapian::InvalidOperationError:  will be thrown if a transaction is not
currently in progress.

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if transactions are not
available for this database type. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::cancel_transaction "

Abort the transaction currently in progress, discarding the pending
modifications made to the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::cancel_transaction()

If an error occurs in this method, an exception will be thrown, but
the transaction will be cancelled anyway.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
modifying the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state.

Xapian::InvalidOperationError:  will be thrown if a transaction is not
currently in progress.

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if transactions are not
available for this database type. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_document "

Add a new document to the database.

Xapian::docid Xapian::WritableDatabase::add_document(const
Xapian::Document &document)

This method adds the specified document to the database, returning a
newly allocated document ID. Automatically allocated document IDs come
from a per-database monotonically increasing counter, so IDs from
deleted documents won't be reused.

If you want to specify the document ID to be used, you should call
replace_document() instead.

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document will either be fully added, or the document fails to be
added and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time when
commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

document:  The new document to be added.

The document ID of the newly added document.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document "

Delete a document from the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document(Xapian::docid did)

This method removes the document with the specified document ID from
the database.

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document will either be fully removed, or the document fails to be
removed and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time when
commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document ID of the document to be removed.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document "

Delete any documents indexed by a term from the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::delete_document(const std::string
&unique_term)

This method removes any documents indexed by the specified term from
the database.

A major use is for convenience when UIDs from another system are
mapped to terms in Xapian, although this method has other uses (for
example, you could add a \"deletion date\" term to documents at index
time and use this method to delete all documents due for deletion on a
particular date).

Parameters:
-----------

unique_term:  The term to remove references to.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document "

Replace a given document in the database.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document(Xapian::docid did,
const Xapian::Document &document)

This method replaces the document with the specified document ID. If
document ID did isn't currently used, the document will be added with
document ID did.

The monotonic counter used for automatically allocating document IDs
is increased so that the next automatically allocated document ID will
be did + 1. Be aware that if you use this method to specify a high
document ID for a new document, and also use
WritableDatabase::add_document(), Xapian may get to a state where this
counter wraps around and will be unable to automatically allocate
document IDs!

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document will either be fully replaced, or the document fails to
be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time when
commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

did:  The document ID of the document to be replaced.

document:  The new document.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document "

Replace any documents matching a term.

Xapian::docid Xapian::WritableDatabase::replace_document(const
std::string &unique_term, const Xapian::Document &document)

This method replaces any documents indexed by the specified term with
the specified document. If any documents are indexed by the term, the
lowest document ID will be used for the document, otherwise a new
document ID will be generated as for add_document.

One common use is to allow UIDs from another system to easily be
mapped to terms in Xapian. Note that this method doesn't automatically
add unique_term as a term, so you'll need to call
document.add_term(unique_term) first when using replace_document() in
this way.

Note that changes to the database won't be immediately committed to
disk; see commit() for more details.

As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic:
the document(s) will either be fully replaced, or the document(s) fail
to be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time
when commit() is called or the database is closed).

Parameters:
-----------

unique_term:  The \"unique\" term.

document:  The new document.

The document ID that document was given.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::WritableDatabase::set_metadata "

Set the user-specified metadata associated with a given key.

void Xapian::WritableDatabase::set_metadata(const std::string &key,
const std::string &metadata)

This method sets the metadata value associated with a given key. If
there is already a metadata value stored in the database with the same
key, the old value is replaced. If you want to delete an existing item
of metadata, just set its value to the empty string.

User-specified metadata allows you to store arbitrary information in
the form of (key, value) pairs.

There's no hard limit on the number of metadata items, or the size of
the metadata values. Metadata keys have a limited length, which depend
on the backend. We recommend limiting them to 200 bytes. Empty keys
are not valid, and specifying one will cause an exception.

Metadata modifications are committed to disk in the same way as
modifications to the documents in the database are: i.e.,
modifications are atomic, and won't be committed to disk immediately
(see commit() for more details). This allows metadata to be used to
link databases with versioned external resources by storing the
appropriate version number in a metadata item.

You can also use the metadata to store arbitrary extra information
associated with terms, documents, or postings by encoding the termname
and/or document id into the metadata key.

Parameters:
-----------

key:  The key of the metadata item to set.

metadata:  The value of the metadata item to set.

Parameters:
-----------

Xapian::DatabaseError:  will be thrown if a problem occurs while
writing to the database.

Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError:  will be thrown if the database is in a
corrupt state.

Xapian::InvalidArgumentError:  will be thrown if the key supplied is
empty.

Xapian::UnimplementedError:  will be thrown if the database backend in
use doesn't support user- specified metadata. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Auto::sortable_serialise "

Convert a floating point number to a string, preserving sort order.

std::string Xapian::sortable_serialise(double value)

This method converts a floating point number to a string, suitable for
using as a value for numeric range restriction, or for use as a sort
key.

The conversion is platform independent.

The conversion attempts to ensure that, for any pair of values
supplied to the conversion algorithm, the result of comparing the
original values (with a numeric comparison operator) will be the same
as the result of comparing the resulting values (with a string
comparison operator). On platforms which represent doubles with the
precisions specified by IEEE_754, this will be the case: if the
representation of doubles is more precise, it is possible that two
very close doubles will be mapped to the same string, so will compare
equal.

Note also that both zero and -zero will be converted to the same
representation: since these compare equal, this satisfies the
comparison constraint, but it's worth knowing this if you wish to use
the encoding in some situation where this distinction matters.

Handling of NaN isn't (currently) guaranteed to be sensible.

Parameters:
-----------

value:  The number to serialise. ";

%feature("docstring")  Xapian::Auto::sortable_unserialise "

Convert a string encoded using sortable_serialise back to a floating

double Xapian::sortable_unserialise(const std::string &serialised)

sortable_serialise(). If the input is not such a string, the value
returned is undefined (but no error will be thrown).

The result of the conversion will be exactly the value which was
supplied to  sortable_serialise() when making the string on platforms
which represent doubles with the precisions specified by IEEE_754, but
may be a different (nearby) value on other platforms.
